You are building a **mobile-first web application** for **Anokha 2025**, a college technical fest.
This application is an **Organizer Attendance Portal** used during live events to mark participant attendance.

---

## 🧠 Core Context

* Platform: **React (Web App)**
* Target Device: **Mobile browsers (Android primarily)**
* Build Tool: **Bun**
* Backend: **Already implemented and fixed**
* You must **only consume APIs**, never design backend logic
* Design style: **Monochrome, minimal, fast, distraction-free**
* Focus: **Reliability, clarity, speed during crowded events**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the App

Organizers will:

* Log in
* Select their assigned event
* Choose an event session (multi-day / multi-session supported)
* Mark attendance via QR scanning or manual override
* View attendance in real time
* Export attendance after the event

No student-facing functionality exists in this app.

## 🔐 Authentication Model

* Organizer login only
* Session-based authentication
* Backend handles authorization
* App must verify session on load
* No signup or password reset flows

---

## 📱 Core Functional Areas

### 1. Organizer Dashboard

* Displays events assigned to the organizer
* Selecting an event opens attendance flow

---

### 2. Session Selection

* Events can have multiple sessions
* Organizer must select a session before attendance
* Once selected, session is **locked**
* Session info must remain visible at all times

---

### 3. Attendance Marking (Core Feature)

#### Supported modes:

* QR scan (primary)
* Manual mark (fallback)

#### Rules:

* One scan per student per session
* In/Out logic handled by backend
* Duplicate scans must be safely blocked
* No offline mode

#### Visual Feedback:

* White flash = success
* Dark flash = error
* Short vibration on scan
* Status text shown briefly

### 4. Manual Attendance Override

Used only when QR fails.

* Search student
* Mark present / remove attendance
* Mandatory confirmation dialog
* Reason selection required
* Logged for audit

---

### 5. Preview Mode (Read-Only)

## 🧩 UI / UX RULES

* Clear visual hierarchy

---

## ⚙️ Technical Constraints
